### Files Given_1

 kaggle_internet.csv:->This dataset contains data for counties with population over 65000, compiled from the 2016 ACS 1-year estimate. ACS 1-year estimates only summarize data for large geographic areas over 65000 population. The 2013-2017 ACS 5-year estimate is expected to be published at the end of 2018, which has data of all geographic areas down to block group level. Before that we will use the latest 2016 1-year estimate. It provides sufficient data for us to gain insight into internet use.
